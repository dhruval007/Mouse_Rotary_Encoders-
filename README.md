| Pin             | Name            | Function                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**           | Output A        | Generates square-wave pulses when wheel rotates           |
| **B**           | Output B        | Same as A but phase-shifted 90° (for direction detection) |
| **C (COM/GND)** | Common Terminal | Shared reference for A & B (usually GND)                  |


Why two outputs?

Because the mouse needs to know scroll direction.

If A leads B → scroll up

If B leads A → scroll down

<h3>🧩 Rotary Encoder Internal Structure – Brief Overview</h3>
<p>The scroll wheel uses a mechanical rotary encoder built from a few simple components.  
The <b>steel casing</b> provides structural support and holds everything in place, while the internal <b>clips</b> act as spring contacts that rub against the <b>turntable</b>. The turntable contains conductive segments that rotate as the wheel moves, generating pulse signals.  
These signals pass through the <b>plastic base with three output pins</b>, allowing the mouse MCU to detect scroll direction and speed.</p>

<h1>Pulse generated by the mouse scroll wheel.</h1>

<p>The rotary encoder generates digital pulse signals as the wheel rotates. Each notch produces a high-low transition forming a square-wave output. When you scroll faster, the pulses occur more frequently and the width becomes narrower. The microcontroller counts these pulses to detect scroll movement and speed.</p>

<h1>Photosensitive Rotation</h1>

<img width="875" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/896a57c3-7ceb-450c-99b1-60d80ae3db79" />

<p>This type of scroll wheel uses a photosensitive sensor instead of a mechanical encoder. 
An LED shines light through the slotted wheel, and a photodiode detects the interruptions 
as the wheel rotates. Each slot passing the beam generates pulses which the controller 
interprets as scroll movement. When replacing the sensor or wheel, the installation height 
and alignment must match the original for accurate detection.</p>

<h1>📌 Rotary Encoder Track Mapping & Output Logic</h1>

<img width="366" height="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0737b011-ab8c-435a-bcfb-db907827321a" />

<p>This diagram shows the internal contact tracks of the mechanical rotary encoder.  
Each colour represents one output channel:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Red (0)</b> → Channel A</li>
<li><b>Yellow (1)</b> → Channel B</li>
<li><b>Blue (2)</b> → Common/GND</li>
</ul>

<p>As the wheel rotates, the conductive segments make and break contact with the wipers, producing  
a sequence of digital output states. The contact patterns generate combinations such as:</p>

<pre>
0   → Only Channel A conducts
1   → Only Channel B conducts
2   → Common reference
01  → A and B active in sequence
12  → B switches relative to Common
02  → A switches relative to Common
012 → Full conduction cycle
</pre>

<p>These combinations create a repeating pattern of states, forming quadrature pulses used to detect 
scroll direction and resolution. Faster rotation results in higher frequency transitions.</p>

<p>As it rotates, different signal combinations appear.

0 02 012 01 02 012 01 02

if the order is in reverse direction, then the scroll operation is in anticlockwise direction
