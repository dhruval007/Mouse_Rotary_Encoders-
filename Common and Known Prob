🛠 Common Scroll Wheel Failure Issue:
The mouse scroll wheel uses a mechanical rotary encoder to detect scroll movement. 
These encoders typically have a lifespan of around 5 million cycles. After extensive usage, 
the internal contacts wear out, leading to scroll skipping, jitter, or complete failure 
When this occurs, the most reliable fix is to replace the rotary encoder with a new unit 
rather than attempting to repair the worn contacts.
